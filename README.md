# Feature-Selection-with-Nearest-Neighbour
In this project, we were tasked with implementing feature selection algorithms, specifically Forward Selection and Backward Elimination, to analyze a given dataset and identify the most significant features that contribute to accurate classification.

Load the datasets and run Feature_Selection_with_Nearest_Neighbour.ipynb
